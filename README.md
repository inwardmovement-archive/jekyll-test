I would like to move my personal website from `inwardmovement.fr` to `inwardmovement.github.io`, but due to GitHub's Jekyll integration limitations, I can't for now.

I'm interested in Jekyll/GitHub native integration that allows to automatically publish a site from its sources on changes, but here is the problem:
- GitHub's Jekyll integration has limitations ;
- Jekyll doesn't suit my needs out of the box. It might with some plugins, but then I loose the native integration's benefits I was interested in.

I may move to Jekyll/GitHub when the following conditions are fulfilled:
- being able to loop in posts from another page than `index.html` ;
- being able to loop in posts — and paginate — within their categories (may be possible with [jekyll-paginate-v2
](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2)) ;
- the above elements are compatible with GitHub Pages integration.

I hope these conditions will be fulfilled some day. For now I will stick to WordPress.
